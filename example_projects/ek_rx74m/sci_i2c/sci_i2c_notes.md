# Introduction #

This Example Project demonstrates SCI_I2C Master operation through loop-back with IIC Slave driver.
6 bytes of data will be transmitted and received continuously on successful initialization. 
The transmitted data is compared with the received data. If the data matches, on-board LED starts blinking. On a data mismatch, LED stays ON.
Failure messages and status is displayed on the Terminal Application.

**Note**: 
- To display information, the user can select between Debug Virtual Console and the Serial Terminal (UART) with USB Serial COM. It is important to note that the user should only operate a single terminal application at a time to avoid conflicts or data inconsistencies. For instructions on how to switch between these options, please refer to the section [`Special Topics`](#special-topics)/[`Changing Terminal Application`](#changing-terminal-application).

- By default, EP information is printed to the host PC using the Serial Terminal (UART) for boards that support USB Serial COM. LED3 is turned ON to indicate the UART initialized unsuccessfully.

- RX boards that support USB Serial COM: EK-RX74M.

LED output Status on Master TX and RX data mismatch (failure) and data match (success).
* Failure  - Led is set as ON
* Success  - Led blinks for each transaction

## Verifying Operation ##
1. Import the example project.

2. Generate, and build the example project.

3. Before running the example project, make sure hardware connections are completed.

4. Connect the RX MCU to the host PC via debugger. By default, EP will use E2lite debugger.
5. Open a terminal application (e.g., Tera Term or Debug Virtual Console) on the host PC and connect to the RX board’s USB Serial port.  
   * Note: For using the Serial Terminal application:
        * To echo back typed content in Tera Term, go to [Setup] -> [Terminal...] and check [Local echo].
        * The configuration parameters of the serial port are:
            - COM port: Provided by the USB Serial COM.
            - Baud rate: 115200 bps
            - Data length: 8 bits
            - Parity: None
            - Stop bit: 1 bit
            - Flow control: None

  **Note:** Connect the RX board debugger port (J9) to the host PC via E2 Emulator Lite (With USB cable and 20-20 pin cable).

### Adding lowsrc Folder

Before changing terminal application settings, you need to add the `lowsrc` folder from another Example Project:

1. **Locate the lowsrc folder:**
   
   - Navigate to Example Project `sci_uart` or `usb_pcdc_with_freertos`  (`example_projects/<board>/sci_uart/e2studio/gccrx_sci_uart_<board>_ep/src`)
   - Find the `lowsrc` folder containing low-level source files.

2. **Copy `lowsrc` folder to this Example Project:**
   
   - Copy the entire `lowsrc` folder.
   - Paste it into this your target Example Project directory: `example_projects/ek_rx74m/<EP>/e2studio/`.

3. **Add lowsrc to e2studio project:**
   
   - In e2studio, right-click on the project in Project Explorer.
   - Select **Refresh** (or press F5) to detect the new folder.

4. **Verify the folder is included:**
   
   - Expand the project tree in Project Explorer.
   - Confirm that `lowsrc` folder and its contents are visible.
   - The folder should be included in the build path with source files ready to compile.

5. **Changing the terminal Application to use the Debug Virtual Console:**
   
   - For instructions on how to switch between these options, please refer to the section [`Special Topics`](#special-topics)/[`Changing Terminal Application`](#changing-terminal-application).

6. **Re-build the project:**
   
   - In e2studio, right-click on the project and select **Build Project**.

**Note:** To use Debug Virtual Console, the `lowsrc` folder must be added to the project, as it contains the source files required for Debug Virtual Console operation.

### Changing Terminal Application ###
By default, the EP supports Serial Terminal for RX boards that support USB Serial COM   
**For use CCRX Compiler:**
* Define USE_VIRTUAL_COM=1 macro in Project Properties -> C/C++ Build -> Settings -> Tool Settings -> Compiler -> Source -> Macro definition (-define)
